# JETSCAPE-Data-Analysis

this repository of code is a collection of python scripts that I wrote in the summer of 2025 while conducting high energy particle physics research at Texas A&M University. The scripts analyze data that was collected via the Monte-Carlo event generator and end to end simulation framework, JETSCAPE. JETSCAPE simulates everything from e plus e minus collisions to heavy ion collisions.
